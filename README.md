## Supporting Swift Bundler ❤️

If you find Swift Bundler useful, please consider supporting me by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/stackotter). I spend most of my spare time working on open-source projects, and each sponsorship helps me focus more time on making high quality tools for the community.

## Documentation 📚

The documentation is hosted on [the Swift Bundler website](https://swiftbundler.dev/documentation/swift-bundler).

## Installation 📦

Install the latest version of Swift Bundler with [mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint):

```sh
mint install stackotter/swift-bundler
```

If you have previously installed Swift Bundler via the installation script you must delete the `/opt/swift-bundler` directory (requires sudo).

For more installation methods, see [the documentation](https://swiftbundler.dev/documentation/swift-bundler/installation).

## Getting started 🚦

After installing Swift Bundler, package templates make it quick to get started. The following sections walk you through creating and running a simple 'Hello, World!' SwiftUI app.

### Creating a SwiftUI app

```sh
# Create a new app from the SwiftUI template.
swift bundler create HelloWorld --template SwiftUI
cd HelloWorld
```

### Running the app

```sh
# Build and run the app.
swift bundler run
```

### Using Xcode as your IDE

```sh
# Creates the files necessary to get xcode to run the package as an app.
# Only needs to be run once unless you delete the `.swiftpm` directory.
swift bundler generate-xcode-support

# Open the package in Xcode
open Package.swift
```

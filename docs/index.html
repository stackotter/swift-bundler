    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Swift Bundler provides a layer over the top of Swift Package Manager that turns built executables into distributable apps. The only setup required is a (git-friendly) configuration file.</p>
    <p>There used to be an early access version, but that has now been merged, and the <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler">public version</a> supports creating both macOS and iOS apps!</p>

    <h1>Why Swift Bundler?</h1>
    
    <h2>Escape Xcode</h2>
    <p>All of us know how frustrating it is when Xcode's syntax highlighting breaks, its auto complete stops working or it crashes and we can't do anything to fix it.</p>
    <p>VSCode and many other code editors are open source (along with their extensions) and the community can easily step up and fix bugs. I use neovim/helix and the autocompletion is more stable than Xcode!</p>
    <p>However, if you still want to use Xcode, Swift Bundler has excellent support for building and running through Xcode without requiring an xcodeproj.</p>
    <p>No more xcodeproj-related merge conflicts!</p>

    <h2>A cross-platform future</h2>
    <p>Swift Bundler supports macOS, Linux, iOS, tvOS, visionOS, and all corresponding Apple platform simulators. In the future I hope to add support for other platforms such as Windows and Android.</p>
    <p>Along with an easy to use cross-platform UI framework (such as <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui">SwiftCrossUI</a>) I believe that Swift can be a great language for developing performant and native cross-platform apps.</p>

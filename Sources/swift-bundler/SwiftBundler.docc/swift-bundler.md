# ``swift_bundler``

Create apps for macOS, iOS, tvOS, Linux and Windows with Swift Package Manager.

## Overview

Swift Bundler builds on top of the Swift Package Manager to enable truly cross-platform development in Swift. It provides a consistent experience across platforms while allowing you to configure platform-specific details when needed.

Apps built with Swift Bundler work everywhere by default, within the limits of your chosen UI framework of course. We recommend using [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/moreSwift/swift-cross-ui) because:

- It provides a native user experience across all platforms supported by Swift Bundler
- It's the most mature cross-platform UI framework for Swift (out of those with at least as many supported platforms)

That said, Swift Bundler doesn't lock you into any particular framework; everything is open and extensible.
